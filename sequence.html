Loop + Selection - Part 4

▶︎ Goal: Even and odd number selection 
1. Use the modulus operator which is % 
2. console.log all foods with even number by UPPERCASE
※ If you take a number and divide(%) it by 2 and the remainder is 0 
it is a even number  
① use (var i = 0; i < foods.length; i++) -> use *i, already defined as a number
② ⎡for (var i = 0; i < foods.length; i++) {
    var remainder = i % 2;
    if (remainder === 0) {
    var foodUpper = foods[i].toUpperCase();
    console.log(`${myString} ${foodUpper} \n`);
    } else {
    console.log(`${myString} ${foods[i]} \n`);
    }
     }⎦ 

     ▶︎ Refactoring Code (making it simpler)
     ▶︎ Make Comments (Git & Github) VERY IMPORTANT
     (1) I can refer back and see the changes I made




Sequence - Part 3 (Loop)
1. made a food array with 4 foods (myself)
2. Used Template Literal `${}` to concatenate string + var
3. made a loop to console.log 4 item's  

    ① ⎡ for (var i = 0; i < foods.length; i++) {
        console.log(`${myString} ${foods[i]}`);
      }⎦ 

    ② ⎡for (var eachFoods of foods) {
        console.log(`${myString} ${foods} \n`);
      }⎦ 

     -> problem solved  
     ⎡for (var eachFood of foods) {
        console.log(`${myString} ${eachFood} \n`);
      }⎦ 

      ※ made a var called *eachFood, 
      but in console.log ${foods} insteand of *${eachFood}



    1. What is Structed Programming? 
    01: Sequence
    Making sure, what comes first and second. Knowing the logic of 'what I want to show' 
    Remember *JS runs ↑↓L to R* 

    02: Selection
    In some cases, there is need for some 'condition'. (IF, ELSE, IF ELSE, FOR etc)  We need to exactly know what we want to do in that selection of programmingREMEMBER, computers are not HUMANS. We have to tell them 'what to do' every single part of sequence. 

    03: Loop
    In some cases, we don't want to overwrite or re-write the code we already made. 
    Reuse if possible so we make our code more efficient. 

    2. What is String Methods?
    ※ always remember !!METHODS!! have *var.method()* -> parentheses(괄호)
    (1) .toUpperCase() -> string to UpperCase
    (2) .toLowerCase() -> string to LowerCase 
    (3) .search () ->  number of that location
    (4) .substr (location(5), really(6)) -> substring (보조) *fetching*
    (5) .replace -> replacing a string to a different word
    ① surgery : modifying our string or num  

      <!SEQUENCE!> 
      var myString = "I am really hungry for some";
      console.log(myString);
      var myUpperString = myString.toUpperCase();
      console.log(myUpperString);
      var reallyLocation = myString.search("really");
      var specialWord = myString.substr(reallyLocation, 6);
      specialWord = specialWord.toUpperCase();
      var newString = myString.replace("really", specialWord);
      console.log(newString);
      ※ code is stacking. You have to build lower + middle + upper : SEQUENCING ※
