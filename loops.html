      /* 03: The For.. Of loop
      ※ always remember 'for' is designed for a loop
      1. Specifically for working with *arrays*
      (1) for..of loop will go through each items in the array untill the 'end' -> finishes
      
      ⎡var food = ["grapes", "cheese", "bread", "olives"];
      for (var eachItem of food) {
        console.log(eachItem);
      }⎦

      2. Strings as Arrays 
      (1) strings can also be treated as an object element if you want [0,1,2,3,4,]
      
      ① ⎡var statement = "A string can be treated like an array";
      for (var i = 0; i < statement.length; i++) {
        console.log(statement[i]);
      }⎦ 

      ② ⎡ var statement = "A string can be treated like an array";
      for (var eachString of statement) {
        console.log(eachString);
      }⎦
        
      ￮ it can be used both ways to get each item in an array

      /* 02: Working with arrays
              var colors = ["red", "blue", "yellow", "green", "purple", "orange"];
            for (var i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
              console.log(colors[i]);
            1. [] :array or object 배열 or 객체 호출
            2. instead of numbers, make it 'general' -> colors.length which is 4
            (1) without changing the num, now I can add more colors into the array
            */
